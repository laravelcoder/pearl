Personal injury attorneys ready to fight for you.



Let’s face it, every lawyer everywhere has gone to law school, passed the Bar exam and joined national, state and local legal organizations. And many law firms, including ours, have earned honors and awards from prestigious professional and community organizations.

All of this counts when you are selecting the lawyers who can best represent you and your family. But our attorneys at Searcy Denney are so much more.

When you meet the members of our team, you may be surprised at the range of personal experience and motivation that drives their passion for justice.

A founding partner whose childhood loss of a little brother inspires his compassion for families who have lost a child;
A shareholder whose love of paragliding and mountain climbing mirrors her passionate representation of clients in the courtroom;
A bilingual lawyer whose “coming to America” story bonds him with the Hispanic community;
An aggressive litigator who compares his courage in the courtroom to jumping out of planes as a U.S. Army paratrooper.




* This amount represents gross verdicts and settlements obtained on behalf of clients over the last 40 years, without adjustment for fees, costs, or medical liens. In some cases, verdicts were amended or appealed, or were not fully recoverable due to the insolvency of defendants. The accounts of recent trials, verdicts and settlements contained in this website are intended to illustrate the experience.

Semi-truck Accident

<p>After a semi accident, insurance companies and trucking companies immediately contact the people injured in the accident and their families.</p>

<p>The transportation industry has undergone tremendous growth in the last few years. More and more 18-wheelers, vans and tour buses are sharing the road with passenger vehicles. Crashes involving commercial motor vehicles and passenger vehicles including automobiles, pickup trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles are on the rise. Large trucks account for a 2.3 fatality rate per 100 million miles traveled vs. 1.5 for vehicles. In 2003, almost 5000 persons died in large truck crashes and 122,000 injured. The highest numbers of truck crashes by crash type are rear-end, ran off road/out of lane, side swipe, rollover, turning across path/into path, and intersecting vehicles. The top factors of truck crashes include driver drug use, traveling too fast for conditions, unfamiliar with roadway and fatigue.</p>

<p>Trucks handle about half of the tonnage carried between cities in the United States. With bigger vehicle, freight can be moved at lower cost. The current federal limit is 80,000 pounds that the standard tractor/trailer is allowed to weigh. When an 80,000 pound 18-wheeler runs into a vehicle, it usually results in a substantial crash.</p>

<p>Adams & Davis has successfully litigated cases involving serious injuries and wrongful death from 18-wheeler, tractor-trailer, bus and automobile accidents.</p>

<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>

<p>Victims of 18-wheeler truck or large commercial motor vehicle collisions deserve an experienced truck accident attorney to represent them against the trucking company and insurance company. An experienced truck accident attorney goes beyond the negligence of the truck driver and investigates the trucking company for negligence in hiring, supervision and entrustment of the 18-wheeler truck.</p>

<p>An attorney with extensive experience and knowledge of 18-wheeler or large commercial motor vehicle litigation can determine, develop and pursue a commercial truck case through extensive discovery, experts in accident reconstruction and trucking, medical consultants and the capture and retrieval of electronic crash data, as well as requesting backup of data produced through satellite systems which many commercial motor vehicles are now equipped.</p>

<p>If you have been in an 18-wheeler or commercial truck accident, contact us online or call us at 801-888-8888 to set up a FREE consultation to discuss your legal options.</p>

<h2>What is a FELA Claims?</h2>

<p>Congress passed FELA in response to the high number of railroad deaths in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Under FELA, railroad workers who are not covered by regular workers' compensation laws are able to sue companies over their injury claims.</p>

<p>The Federal Employees Liability Act (FELA) was enacted by Congress to provide benefits to the railroad workers who sustained injuries in the course and scope of his employment. To recover damages under a FELA claim, the injured worker must establish that the railroad caused or contributed to his accident. </p>

<p>The injuries that are governed under FELA include: (1) traumatic injuries, such as broken bones and back strain (2) repetitive stress injuries that develop gradually – such as carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss (3) aggravation of pre-existing injuries, (4) occupational diseases – such as lung cancer, skin diseases and asbestos related diseases.</p>

<p>A claim under FELA must be filed within three (3) years from the date of accident. In the case of repetitive stress or occupational diseases, the statute of limitations of three (3) years begins to run from the time the injured worker knew or should have known that they may have a work related injury. The attorneys at Adams & Davis are experienced in FELA claims.</p>

<p>If you or your loved one has been injured in the course and scope of your employment with the railroad, contact us online or call us at 801-888-8888 to set up a FREE consultation to discuss your legal options.</p>


FELA Claims

Compensation claims made under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) generally generate significantly higher payouts than claims made under state workers’ compensation.

SLIP & FALL INJURIES IN POLK COUNTY

WHAT IS A SLIP AND FALL CASE?

Premises liability law holds property owners accountable for the conditions of their property. Under these laws, landowners must maintain reasonable standards of care and safety on their properties. Additionally, premises liability laws ensure the rights of individuals injured due to unsafe conditions on these premises to pursue compensation for their injuries and associated damages. Many of these injuries are the result of incidents classified as "slip and fall" accidents.

Dangerous conditions that could be responsible for a slip and fall accident include:

Missing steps
Broken railings
Uneven sidewalks
Unmarked wet floors
Obstacles or extreme clutter
Wet or icy walkways

Unfortunately, there have been recent changes to Florida state law regarding slip and fall injuries. These changes make it more difficult for injury victims to obtain the compensation they need - and even more important to obtain the assistance of a qualified Polk County personal injury lawyer. At Abercrombie, P.A., we understand these changes and are prepared to protect your rights.
